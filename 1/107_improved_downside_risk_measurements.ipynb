    "# Semi Deviation, VaR, and CVaR\n",
    "\n",
    "## Estimating CVaR\n",
    "_There are 4 standard methodologies for calculating VaR_:\n",
    "* Historical methodology (non-parameterisation)\n",
    "* Variance-Covariance (parametric Gaussian)\n",
    "* Parametric non-Gaussian\n",
    "* Cornish-Fisher (semi-parametric)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Historical Methodology\n",
    "* Based on the distribution of historical changes\n",
    "* There are no assumptions made, there is no risk of misspecification\n",
    "* However, the sole reliance on historical data makes the estimation highly dependent on the sample\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parametric Guassian Methodology\n",
    "* Approaches know as parametric approachs\n",
    "    * You come up with a specific assumption about the return distribution, then the focus is estimating the parameters of that return distribution\n",
    "* Simple to assume a Gaussian distribution, but assuming this gives a large model risk as we have fat tails\n",
    "* Example: A portfolio with a +.5% monthly expected return and 4% monthly volatility. A 95% monthly Gaussian VaR for the portfolio = -(0.5% - 1.65 x 4%) = 6.1%\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parametric non-Gaussian\n",
    "* Can be parametric but not Gaussian\n",
    "* Includes distributions, like: _Pareto, Student with a>0 degrees of freedom, Loggamma, Frechet_\n",
    "* There is a specification risk as the data might not fit the distribution chosen\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cornish-Fisher\n",
    "* Attempt at best of two world\n",
    "* No specific return distribution is assumed\n",
    "* Using Gaussian and then contains corrections in the forms of a fraction of skewness and kurtosis\n"
