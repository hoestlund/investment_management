    ">Recent market crises have highlighted the benefits of risk-controlled strategies that allow investors to benefit from downside risk protection. This module describes a wide set of risk insurance strategies, starting with basic Constant Proportion Portfolio Insurance (CPPI) strategies, and moving on to more sophisticated strategies that aim at achieving the highest possible upside potential while imposing stringent limits to portfolio drawdown.\n",
