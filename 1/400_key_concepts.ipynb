    ">The main focus of this module is on the design of optimal allocation strategies for investors endowed with long-term liability or consumption objectives, a framework suitable to most institutional investors but also to private investors. It presents the state of the art in asset-liability management (ALM) with a specific emphasis on defining the investor's objectives and constraints, formalizing the risk-return trade-off in terms of final funding ratio and minimizing the opportunity costs of short-term constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    ">We emphasize the liability-driven investing paradigm, which leads to the recognition that investment decisions should not be framed in terms of one all-encompassing reference policy portfolio, but instead in terms of two distinct reference portfolios, namely a liability-hedging portfolio and a performance-seeking portfolio."

    "> The standard paradigm for pension fund investments, which used to be firmly grounded around one overarching foundational concept of the policy portfolio, is slowly but surely being replaced by a new, more modern, investment paradigm known as the dynamic liability-driven investing (DLDI) paradigm. \n",
    "This new paradigm has two main defining characteristics: \n",
    "* a focus on the management of portfolio risk relative to the liabilities, as opposed to absolute risk\n",
    "* a focus on dynamically time-varying allocation within and across the risky and the safe building blocks. "
