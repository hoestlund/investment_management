# Alternative Data

## Consumption data
  * Where are people, what are they buying

> _understand what consumption data is, we'll try to understand what types of consumption data are available for financial market participants, and we'll try to motivate why it's so important for these financial market participants; traders, portfolio managers, researchers to consider seriously the use of consumption data_

### Main idea

* Why we need to be thoughtful
  * Tradeoffs sample size vs granuality
    * Credit card transactions have many different providers. Large companies can break down logs by sectors, have a high amount of samples but usually. Startups will have smaller samples but more granular data.
  * Incedental traffic
    * Example would be attempting to count cars when the place of business is near a busy street
